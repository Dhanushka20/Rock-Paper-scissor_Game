# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game! This is a classic game implemented in Python where players compete against the computer in a series of rock, paper, scissors matches.

## Introduction

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple yet entertaining game where players select one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The goal is to choose an option that beats the one chosen by the opponent. With this implementation, you can play against the computer and see who wins more matches.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay against the computer.
- Simple user interface with text-based input and output.
- Random selection of options by the computer.

## How to Play

1. **Input Your Choice**: Type "rock", "paper", or "scissors" when prompted, or press 'Q' to exit the game.
2. **See the Result**: The computer will randomly select its choice, and the winner of the round will be displayed.
